# Snowpack Demo
This demo app includes React with TypeScript.

## Scripts
- `npm start` - starts the development server.
- `npm run build` - compiles the production build.

## Production Build
The production build can be easily tested with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code. Once downloaded, you will need to run the build script above. Navigate to the `build` folder and right click on the `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
